                Who would have thought that there is a real desert in Kazakhstan, which is nicknamed Naryn-kum. This is a huge expanse of sand hills and dunes. In the Zhangolinsky district of the West Kazakhstan region near the village of "New Kazanka" there are several dunes. There are only five of them. Here the Ryn â€” sands originate, which extend to the Caspian Sea. In addition to the magnificent views, the local sands surprise with their ancient finds.. According to archaeologists, in Naryn-kum, you can easily find fragments of ancient dishes, arrowheads or the remains of an ancient man.  </div>
