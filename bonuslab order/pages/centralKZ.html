                Ulytau (Great Mountains)

                 Majestic mounds, necropolises, mausoleums of Begazy-Dandybay culture, rock carvings, petroglyphs, mines, metallurgical furnaces in which copper, tin, silver, gold and other ancient monuments were smelted found and examined by scientists indicate that Ulytau has been the center of Saryarka and the entire steppe since ancient times.
                The greatness of these ancient mountains lies in the significance of the events of the national history of Kazakhstan. Ulytau was a favorite place of the khans of nomadic tribes. The headquarters of Zhosha Khan, the eldest son of Genghis Khan, was stationed here, from here Batu Khan began his conquering campaign to the east.
                Mausoleums of Zhoshy Khan and Alash Khan were erected in Ulytau. The khan of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh, the great Horde commander Emir Edyge, is also buried here. On the stone slab of Ulytau mountain Altynshoky left the memory of his stay in the spring of 1391, the great Tamerlane.

                The Karkaraly and Kent Mountains, united by the borders of the Karkaraly National Natural Park, are one of the most popular vacation spots among residents of Central Kazakhstan. It should be noted, however, that this is more applicable to the Karkaraly Mountains, where, in addition to mountain peaks and pine forests, numerous lakes are added to the services of vacationers.

                Lake Balkhash is the largest drainless reservoir after the Caspian and Aral Seas. The length of the lake is 614 km, the width is from 3.5 to 44 km, the maximum depth reaches 26 m. The phenomenon of Balkhash consists in the different mineralization of its western and eastern parts connected by a narrow strait. The western basin, which receives water from the previously highâ€“water Ili River, is fresh, the eastern one is brackish. The nature of Balkhash is amazing and full of contrasts. The reservoirs of the Ili-Balkhash basin are one of the most significant in terms of biodiversity and reproduction of valuable fish species.
                The lake is located in three regions of Kazakhstan at once: Almaty, Zhambyl and Karaganda. To the north of the lake there is a vast Kazakh melkosopochnik, to the west stretches Betpak-Dala, and in the south there are the Chu-Ili Mountains, the sands of Taukum and Saryesik-Atyrau.
                There are about 20 species of fish in the lake, there are also 120 species of birds, of which 12 were included in the Red Book.
