                Lake Markakol is one of the most beautiful lakes in Kazakhstan. The lake and the places around attract with their magical untouched beauty and mystery. It is located at an altitude of 1,447 meters above sea level. 
                The nature around the lake is fascinating at first sight. The lake is surrounded by dense forests, and the water in the lake changes color depending on the weather: on a clear day it is a green-blue surface that glows from the bright sun. The main wealth of the lake is fish, and above all uskuch, which is found only in Markakol. The fish is very valuable, similar to salmon. Since the territory of the lake is considered a protected area, that you can fish here only with permission, keep this in mind if you suddenly decide to go fishing.

                A unique natural monument stretching 300 hectares in the middle of the desert. Blood-red and orange-yellow stone mushrooms, mysterious ancient rocks are all mysterious Kiin-Kerish. The landscapes of the amazing canyon landscape combined with the hot hot air and the complete absence of water create a unique cosmic atmosphere of the red planet. Kiin-Kerish is called the "City of Spirits" and various legends are composed about it. Geologists believe that Kiin-Kirish is a unique paleontological monument, it covers an area of about 300 hectares. The bright coloring of the clay rocks suggests that they were formed in the hot and humid tropical climate of the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs dominated the earth. </div>

                Mountains have always amazed people with their greatness, inaccessibility and unpredictability. From their slopes, people admired picturesque valleys and gorges, noisy waterfalls and stormy rivers. Mount Belukha impresses with the severity and steepness of the ice and snow walls. The mountain has two distinct peaks - Eastern Belukha (4,509 meters) and Western Belukha (4,435 meters), but there is also a third peak - Delaunay Peak (4,260 meters), which makes up a single mountain range with Belukha. Nikolai Konstantinovich Roerich wrote about Belukha: "Belukha is the Twilight of Asia, stands as a snow-white witness of the past and a guarantor of the future."</div>
